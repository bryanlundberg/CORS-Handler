# **CORS-Handler**

CORS-Handler is a versatile proxy solution designed to alleviate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) complications in frontend web development. With this tool, you can easily circumvent CORS restrictions when making requests to external resources.

### How It Works

By sending your HTTP requests through CORS-Handler using the following format:

`https://cors-proxy-0rcx.onrender.com/https://your-url-to-fetch` 

Usage example:

    https://cors-proxy-0rcx.onrender.com/https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto

You'll receive a clean, unrestricted response, ensuring your frontend applications can seamlessly access data from different domains without encountering CORS roadblocks.



### Key Features

-   Seamlessly resolve CORS issues in your frontend projects.
-   Facilitates secure cross-origin requests without having a server.
-   Simplifies the process of integrating external APIs and resources.
-   Lightweight and easy to use.
